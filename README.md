##Data Challenge

All candidates must complete the Brooklyn Data Science data challenge, which is comprised of two parts: 

**Part 1: Statistics and Probability Fundamentals Test**. (Refer to *STATISTICS-TEST-INSTRUCTIONS.md* for the 
specific instructions and questions to Part 1).

**Part 2: Data Analysis Case Study**. (Refer to *CASE-STUDY-INSTRUCTIONS.md* for the specific instructions to Part 2).

Our aim with the data challenge is to assess both your conceptual understanding of statistics and data analysis, as well as your ability to work with real, messy data and makes sense of it, practically.

##General Instructions
1. Clone this repo onto your desktop. **Do not fork this repo**.

2. Copy the contents of this repo into a new repo called **bkds-datachallenge-YourLastName-YourFirstName**. 
(If for some statistically unlikely reason this repo already exists in the Github universe, call your repo 
bkds-datachallenge-YourLastName-YourFirstName-YourFavoriteInteger).

3. Publish your repo to Github, make it private, and grant access to jjbeach.

4. Commit your work to your repo as you make progress. Do not upload all your work and commit everything at the very end. 
We'll be reviewing your commit history in evaluating your candidacy to the platform.

5. When you're finished, login to your Brooklyn Data Science account, click on the "Data Challenge" tab, 
type your repo name in the field shown, and click submit. This will notify us that you're finished.

##Timeline
There's no time limit, but we suggest completing the data challenge within 14 days from the time your Brooklyn Data Science candidate account was created. 

##Honor Code
You can use any textbooks, online guides, etc. to complete the data challenge, but all of your answers to Part 1 and the work done 
in Part 2 must **be your own**. You cannot outsource or ask a friend to do it for you.
