##Case Study Instructions

For the second part of the Brooklyn Data Science challenge, we want to get a sense of your ability to solve a real-world data science problem. Thus, you have two options for the case study:

###Option 1: If you've recently completed a project, thesis, or dissertation that you believe demonstrates i) your proficiency in collecting and processing real-world data, ii) designing the best methods to solve the problem, and iii) implementing a solution, then you can simply submit your case study in lieu of our case study below. 

###Option 2: Case Study

You've just been hired as a lead data scientist for a local company that buys and sells properties for corporate rentals in 
New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The property acquistion team wants to better price its units, 
and they believe the listing data on Airbnb can be a useful proxy.

Your job is to help this team assess the variability in pricing across Airbnb listings in the targeted cities,
as well as discover any implicit relationships in the data. You will be required to to tell a story about the types of listings in these markets and identify any predictive patterns with which the property acquistion team can use for their deals.

###1. Data Munging
Using either R or Python, create a program that will pull, clean, and normalize all data that you deem relevant for a given Airbnb listing from each of the following urls:
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-York--NY
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco--CA
  
  https://www.airbnb.com/s/Los-Angeles

The end result should be a clean data set with which you'll perform your analysis.
  
###2. Exploratory Data Mining
Once you have your clean data set, you should investigate any implicit patterns in your constructed data set. One goal is to indentify any listings in the same group that are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

###3. Listing Price Prediction

After exploring the data, your next task will be to create a supervised learning algorithm that predictes the price of an Airbnb listing in these markets. You must be able to justify your choice of features (variables) for any model you use, and discuss the process by which you validated your model (e.g., influential points, heteroscedasticity, collinearity, PRESS, cross validation, etc.)

###4. Findings and Communication

Your job is to not only interpret the data but to also effectively communicate your findings to other stakeholders; itâ€™s very important for you to be able to communicate and present your findings in a way that is easy to understand for your team, both technical and non-technical. Please use any data visualizations to show any relevant information from your analysis.
